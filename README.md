# Air Quality and Hospital Admission Rates 🫁

A comparison of air quality throughout the year of 2022 and how it affected hospital admission rates; a closer look at how the environment impacts respiratory health. Right now in the timeline of this project I'm focusing specifically on Ozone and PM2.5 values in four Kentucky counties.


## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python packages:  
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open `air_quality_and_hospital_admission_rates_in_2022.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebooks
    
## Usage

The analysis shows that PM2.5 values outweigh Ozone values in the selected counties for 2022.
